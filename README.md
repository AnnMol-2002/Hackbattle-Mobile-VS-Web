## Inspiration
There are many reasons why a sustainable online shopping platform for women's fashion is needed. The fashion industry is known for its negative impact on the environment, from the use of water, energy, and resources to the production of waste and pollution. Women, in particular, are often targeted by fast fashion companies, which promote a culture of disposable clothing and encourage frequent purchases that harm the environment.

However, the idea of a sustainable fashion platform for women is not only about addressing environmental concerns. It is also about promoting ethical and fair trade practices in the fashion industry, which can help improve the lives of workers and communities around the world.

By providing a platform that offers eco-friendly, ethically produced, and durable fashion items, women can feel empowered to make sustainable choices that align with their values. Moreover, by offering these items at affordable prices, the platform can make sustainable fashion accessible to a wider audience, helping to reduce the impact of the fashion industry on the environment and promoting social justice.

Ultimately, a sustainable fashion platform for women is not just about fashion, but about promoting a more sustainable and just world for everyone. By aligning fashion with sustainability and ethical practices, we can create a better future for ourselves and for generations to come.

## How we built it
Since we are complete beginners to mobile app development, we used Figma to design the prototype of the app. Using the help of FlutLab we converted the Figma prototype to flutter code. 

## Challenges we ran into
Being beginners we faced issues in real world implementation of the app. Also faced difficulties in gaining solid understanding of the programming languages and frameworks, which can be intimidating and time-consuming to learn.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
1. Creating an efficient and effective platform for shopping
2. Achieving sustainability goals
3. learning new ttechnologies

## What we learned
Learned to work in a team under pressure and the most important thing is time management. Learned about flutter, Dart, and more features of Figma. 

## What's next for Femmefinds
1. Improving Back- end of the app
2. Including more sustainable and eco-friendly products
